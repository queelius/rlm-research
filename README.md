# RLM research notebook

This repository makes the small, readable part of our recursive language model
research available outside the GPU cluster. It is a publication snapshot, not a
backup of the working filesystem and not a claim that every experiment succeeded.

Latest partial refresh: September 12, 2026, 10:16 UTC. It adds the recent RL
comparisons, helper-input experiments, and their sealed source scripts. Other
records retain their earlier cutoffs; this is not live GPU status. The latest
plain-language synthesis is also in the
[September 12 research report](https://github.com/queelius/rlm/blob/54372e5/docs/research-checkpoints/2026-09-12-exploration-and-helper-contracts.md).

## Start here

- [Current conclusions](research/r4/analyses/CURRENT_SUMMARY.md).
- [The most promising findings](research/r4/analyses/PROMISING_RESULTS.md).
- [Research questions](research/r4/questions/README.md) and [supported claims](research/r4/claims/README.md).
- [Advisor slides, PDF, and presenter guide](https://github.com/queelius/rlm/tree/83cd0269da9774aa2280cc3d3f462178ea894bf9/slides/2026-09-11-advisor-meeting).
- [Complete snapshot index](INDEX.md), including earlier research rounds.

The central question is whether a small model can do more useful work by learning
to inspect a problem, ask smaller questions, and combine the answers correctly.
The notebook retains promising results, unsuccessful approaches, limitations,
corrections, and proposed next experiments. A proposal or a runnable script is
not evidence that an experiment was completed.

## How this fits together

| Location | Contents |
|---|---|
| [rlm](https://github.com/queelius/rlm) | Runtime code, tests, documentation, and presentation source. |
| This repository | Research questions, claim records, reports, ideas, experiment scripts, and compact evidence metadata. |
| Separate artifact storage | Large traces, datasets, model weights, and checkpoints; see [artifact availability](ARTIFACTS.md). |

The [source-repository record](SOURCE_REPOSITORIES.json) identifies the related
projects and their local commits when this snapshot was made. They provide code
or research ideas; their results must not be pooled without an explicit comparison.

## Read the evidence carefully

These are exploratory studies. Many tests reuse public source data or previously
examined contexts. Reports distinguish missing outcomes from observed failures,
correct final answers from actually performing the requested calculation, and
local improvements from improvements to a complete task.

The [manifest](MANIFEST.json) records original paths, file hashes, publication
paths, and any link rewriting. Original records were copied, not moved. Source
files and active GPU jobs were not changed by publication. This is a per-file
snapshot of a live research store, not a transactionally frozen experiment bundle.

Some scripts retain cluster-specific paths and depend on artifacts not included
here. This notebook is therefore not yet a one-command reproduction package.
Links to omitted local artifacts lead to the availability explanation; omitted
artifacts are not silently represented as publicly downloadable.

See [the publishing policy](PUBLISHING.md) for size limits, exclusions, and refresh
instructions. Third-party material retains its original rights and license;
publication here does not assign a new blanket license to datasets or imported code.
